# üó£Ô∏è Artificial Voice for Humanoid Robot Ameca

This project explores the impact of synthetic voice profiles on human perception of the **Ameca humanoid robot**, conducted at the Robotics Research Lab (RRLAB), RPTU Kaiserslautern. The study integrates **text-to-speech (TTS)** technologies with **human-robot interaction (HRI)** design principles to evaluate user impressions and voice quality.

## üéØ Objectives

- Implement and test multiple **Text-to-Speech voice profiles** (male, female, and gender-neutral)
- Analyze how voice pitch, tone, and style affect **perceived intelligence**, **naturalness**, and **likeability**
- Use **Godspeed** and **MOS questionnaires** to quantify user impressions
- Inform future **design of customizable voices** in humanoid robots

---

## üß™ Methods

- 24 participants, within-subjects design
- 5 voice profiles (Graham, Joanna, Lucy, Matthew, Plus Q)
- Robot: **Ameca** by Engineered Arts
- Statistical analysis using **JASP** (Repeated Measures ANOVA)
- TTS tools: **Amazon Polly**, **Acapela**, **Plus Q**, and open-source **StyleTTS2**

---

## üõ† Technologies Used

- Python (for any TTS or playback scripts)
- JASP (for statistical analysis)
- Amazon Polly, Acapela, Plus Q, StyleTTS2

---

## üìå Key Findings

- **Voice quality** significantly influenced perception (Joanna and Matthew > Graham)
- **Voice impression** showed trends toward significance (Lucy and Plus Q rated better than Graham)
- **Gender and expressiveness of the voice** affected perceived intelligence and likability

These results emphasize the importance of selecting and customizing voice profiles in **humanoid robot design**, particularly in socially interactive contexts.
